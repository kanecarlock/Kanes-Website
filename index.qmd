I am a 4th year Ph.D. candidate in School Psychology at Indiana University-Bloomington. I am currently applying for APPIC internships with behavioral health training in [integrated primarycare](https://www.cfha.net/learn-network/what-is-integrated-care/). I am also a member of the School-Based Mental Health Research and Training Initiative [SBMH-RTI](https://www.sbmhinitiative.com), led by Dr. Heather Ormiston.     

My research and clinical interests are focused on the integration of behavioral health services within and across primary care and schools. This work is guided by frameworks from public health [MTSS](https://mtss4success.org/essential-components) and implementation science ([EPIS](https://episframework.com/); [NPT](https://implementationscience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13012-022-01191-x)). My methodological interests include quantitative methods with the [R statistical software](https://www.r-project.org/).
