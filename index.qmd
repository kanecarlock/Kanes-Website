I am a Ph.D. candidate in School Psychology at Indiana University-Bloomington and a member of the School-Based Mental Health Research and Training Initiative [SBMH-RTI](https://www.sbmhinitiative.com), lead by Dr. Heather Ormiston. I am also the assistant director for the Child Assessment and Intervention Clinic (CAIC) in the IU School of Education.

My research is broadly focused on the delivery of youth mental health services. This work is guided by frameworks from public health ([MTSS; Collaborative Care](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5383210/)) and implementation science ([EPIS](https://episframework.com/); [NPT](https://implementationscience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13012-022-01191-x)). Specific interest include: 

1) Advancing the integration youth mental health services in school, hospital, and primary care settings.

2) Investigating contextual factors that influence how professionals and organizations implement evidence-based mental health services while de-implementing low value practices. 

3) Identifying inequities to access to mental health services. 

My methodological interests include quantitative methods using the R statistical software, mixed-methods, and improving the translation of research into practice through meta-science and reproducibility.
