I am a 4th-year Ph.D. candidate in School Psychology at Indiana University-Bloomington and a member of the School-Based Mental Health Research and Training Initiative [SBMH-RTI](https://www.sbmhinitiative.com), led by Dr. Heather Ormiston.     

My research and clinical interests are broadly focused on the delivery of youth mental health services. This work is guided by frameworks from public health ([MTSS; Collaborative Care](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5383210/)) and implementation science ([EPIS](https://episframework.com/); [NPT](https://implementationscience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13012-022-01191-x)). Specific research interest include: 

1) Advancing the integration of youth mental health services in school, hospital, and primary care settings.
2) Investigating contextual factors that influence how professionals and organizations implement evidence-based mental health services while de-implementing low-value practices. 
3) Identifying inequities in mental health service access. 

My methodological interests include quantitative methods using the R statistical software, mixed-methods, and improving the translation of research into practice through meta-science and reproducibility.
