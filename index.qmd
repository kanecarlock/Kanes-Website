I am a Ph.D. candidate in School Psychology at Indiana University-Bloomington and a member of the School-Based Mental Health Research and Training Initiative [SBMH-RTI](https://www.sbmhinitiative.com), led by Dr. Heather Ormiston.     

My research and clinical interests are focused on the delivery and integration of pediatric mental health services in the settings where families are most likely to routinely visit such as [primary care, hospital, and school settings](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10488-018-00916-9). This work is guided by frameworks from public health ([Integrated Care](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10880-017-9512-0); [MTSS](https://mtss4success.org/essential-components)) and implementation science ([EPIS](https://episframework.com/); [NPT](https://implementationscience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13012-022-01191-x)). My methodological interests include quantitative methods with the [R statistical software](https://www.r-project.org/) and using data science to improve research, training, and practice.
