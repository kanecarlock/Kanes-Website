    "text": "My research and clinical interests are focused on the delivery and integration of pediatric mental health services in school, primary care, and hospital settings. This work is guided by frameworks from public health (MTSS; Collaborative Care) and implementation science (EPIS; NPT). My methodological interests include quantitative methods (i.e., data science) using the R statistical software and improving the translation of research into practice through meta-science and reproducibility.\nI have compiled resources for Learning R, Learning Stats, and Learning Implementation Science. Feel free to use these resources for your own learning.\nMore information about me can be found on My CV and on Twitter at @kanecarlock. I can be contacted at kanecarlock6507@gmail.com."
