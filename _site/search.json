This work is guided by frameworks from public health (MTSS; Collaborative Care) and implementation science (EPIS; NPT).\nMy methodological interests include quantitative methods using the R statistical software, mixed-methods, and improving the translation of research into practice through meta-science and reproducibility.\nMore information about me can be found on my CV and on Twitter at @kanecarlock. I can be contacted at kanecarlock6507@gmail.com."
