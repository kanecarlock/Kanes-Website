This work is guided by frameworks from public health (MTSS; Collaborative Care) and implementation science (EPIS; NPT). Specific interest include:\n\nAdvancing the integration youth mental health services in school, hospital, and primary care settings.\nInvestigating contextual factors that influence how professionals and organizations implement evidence-based mental health services while de-implementing low value practices.\nIdentifying inequities to access to mental health services.\n\nMy methodological interests include quantitative methods using the R statistical software, mixed-methods, and improving the translation of research into practice through meta-science and reproducibility."
