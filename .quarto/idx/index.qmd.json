This work is guided by frameworks from public health ([MTSS; Collaborative Care](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5383210/)) and implementation science ([EPIS](https://episframework.com/); [NPT](https://implementationscience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13012-022-01191-x)). Specific reserach interest include: \n\n1) Advancing the integration youth mental health services in school, hospital, and primary care settings.\n2) Investigating contextual factors that influence how professionals and organizations implement evidence-based mental health services while de-implementing low value practices. \n3) Identifying inequities to mental health service access. \n\nMy methodological interests include quantitative methods using the R statistical software, mixed-methods, and improving the translation of research into practice through meta-science and reproducibility.\n\nMore information can be found on my [CV](https://www.kanecarlock.com/cv.html) and on Twitter at [@kanecarlock](https://twitter.com/kanecarlock).
