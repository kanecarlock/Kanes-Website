I am currently applying for APPIC internships with behavioral health training in [integrated primarycare](https://www.cfha.net/learn-network/what-is-integrated-care/). I am also a member of the School-Based Mental Health Research and Training Initiative [SBMH-RTI](https://www.sbmhinitiative.com), led by Dr. Heather Ormiston.     \n\nMy research and clinical interests are focused on the integration of behavioral health services in primary care and school settings. This work is guided by frameworks from public health ([Integrated Care](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10880-017-9512-0); [MTSS](https://mtss4success.org/essential-components)) and implementation science ([EPIS](https://episframework.com/); [NPT](https://implementationscience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13012-022-01191-x)). My methodological interests include quantitative methods with the [R statistical software](https://www.r-project.org/).\n\nMore information about me can be found on [My CV](https://www.kanecarlock.com/my%20cv) and on Twitter at [@kanecarlock](https://twitter.com/kanecarlock).
